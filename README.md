Code for Kinect hand location used with permission from Professor Janusz Konrad, Boston University ECE and student mentors.
Code for Pong game and helper methods authored by Andrew Hoang, Boston University ECE ('18, expected).

The point of this project was to develop a software-based game that included Kinect interaction for the ENG EK131 class at BU. 
Logic is done in the MainWindow and Form1 classes, which create a Kinect tracking window (WPF format) and a Pong game-playing window (WinForms format) respectively.
